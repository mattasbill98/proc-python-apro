# PROC PYTHON usage in the Analytics Pro container

This repository contains an analytics example for using the Python procedure in SAS's Analytics Pro on Viya.

After PROC PYTHON has been enabled, the Logistic Regression code can be pasted into the SAS Studio window. The libname statement can be changed to better fit your needs but the data, the Iris dataset, should be within the sashelp libraries for use.
